# Udemy Svelte JS

Compilation of output and guide notes when studying the course. Do note that codes and interface are not exactly the same with the instructor since I used TailwindCSS for the styling. And also added other functionalities (e.g. use:actions, 404 page, ts types, custom stores, etc.) using Svelte + Typescript.
